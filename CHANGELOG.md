## 1.0.2 - 2021-11-11
- Update for regex searching text in messages. Previously text in blocks was not being searched, meaning posts made by bots, or users formatting posts using Block Kit, were not being detected.

## 1.0.1 - 2021-11-02
- Tuning for ITIN rule to stop as many FPs
- Logging modified to shorten "user" section (previously contained all workspaces the user was part of). This gives shorter JSON that should work better with Jira alerting

## 1.0.0 - 2021-10-19
- Initial release
